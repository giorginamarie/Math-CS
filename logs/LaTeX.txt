### [2025-10-22] Connected Overleaf Project to GitHub Repository
Context: Set up sync between Overleaf project *Math-CS* and GitHub repo *Math-CS* to manage LaTeX notes (MTH-3250, CSE-2050, Algebra) within a unified workflow.  
Action: Added Overleaf as a remote to the existing local GitHub repo, merged Overleaf’s `master` branch into local `main`, and established dual-remote commands for ongoing sync. Developed workflow for push/pull.  
Result: Overleaf, local, and GitHub repositories are now aligned. Workflow supports future updates with `git pull overleaf master`.
