### [2025-10-22] Initialized GitHub Repository and Local Folder Structure
Context: Began setup of the Math-CS repository to manage mathematics, computer science, and ChatGPT project materials within a unified workflow.
Action: Created directory hierarchy in Google Drive (ChatGPT/Math-CS), initialized Git with main branch, added .gitignore, README.md, and initial PROJECT_LOG-Math-CS.md. Configured Sublime Text as default Git editor and reviewed Git branch conventions.
Result: Local Git repository fully initialized and structured for academic and AI-assisted work, ready for connection to GitHub.
